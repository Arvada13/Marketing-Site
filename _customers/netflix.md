challenge: |
  Netflix has a number of informational websites for customers and partners such as [Netflix Devices](https://devices.netflix.com).

  As such a fast moving company, Netflix needed an innovative way of creating and maintaining these sites. Existing solutions were inflexible, time consuming for developers to maintain and difficult for the marketing team to update.
solution: |
  Netflix partnered with CloudCannon to rebuild [Netflix Devices](https://devices.netflix.com). Devices was originally a Drupal site and was rebuilt in a fraction of the time using Jekyll. The site is static so it loads quickly, scales to the millions of Netflix visitors and is reliable.

  The marketing team have taken control of their sites. They can quickly try out new messaging and update content directly on the page.

  Netflix gets sites online and in front of customers faster than has ever been possible.
