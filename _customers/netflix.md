## The Challenge

Netflix continues to grow as the world's largest internet television network boasting over 65 million members. With such a large user base, Netflix has a number of informational websites for customers and partners such as the [Netflix Devices site](https://devices.netflix.com).

To keep up with the rest of Netflix, they needed an innovative way of handling these sites. Developers wanted a way to build sites faster, have complete flexibility over the designs and scale them to millions of visitors. Marketers needed to easily update content without having to talk to a developer.

## How CloudCannon helped

Netflix has rebuilt a number of sites with CloudCannon. The sites were built in a fraction of the time using Jekyll.  Because the sites are static, they load quickly, scale to the millions of Netflix visitors and are extremely reliable.

The marketing team have taken control of their sites. They can quickly try out new messaging and update content directly on the page.

Netflix gets sites online and in front of customers faster than has ever been possible.
