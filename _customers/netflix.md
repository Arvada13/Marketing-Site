challenge: |
  Netflix is the world’s leading Internet television network. The company works hard to provide its partners and consumers with information at a fast pace to maintain its position as an industry leader. One of the ways Netflix does this is by ensuring informational websites stay up to date with relevant and engaging content.

  Maintaining sites such as this was a difficult process. Existing solutions were inflexible in the kind of edits they allowed. The marketing team would struggle to make the edits they needed. Often, help from developers was required. Netflix needed an innovative, fast paced way of creating and maintaining these sites to empower marketers and free up developer time.
solution: |
  Netflix partnered with CloudCannon to rebuild [Netflix Devices](https://devices.netflix.com). Devices was originally a Drupal site and was rebuilt in a fraction of the time using Jekyll. The site is static so it loads quickly, scales to the millions of Netflix visitors and is reliable.

  The marketing team have taken control of their sites. They can quickly try out new messaging and update content directly on the page.
