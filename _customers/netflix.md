challenge: |
  Netflix has a number of informational websites for customers and partners such as [Netflix Devices](https://devices.netflix.com).

  As such a fast moving company, Netflix needed an innovative way of creating and maintaining these sites. Existing solutions were time consuming for developers to maintain and scale, inflexible and difficult for the marketing team to update.
solution: |
  Netflix rebuilt [Devices](https://devices.netflix.com) with CloudCannon. The site was built in a fraction of the time using Jekyll.  Because the sites are static, they load quickly, scale to the millions of Netflix visitors and are extremely reliable.

  The marketing team have taken control of their sites. They can quickly try out new messaging and update content directly on the page.

  Netflix gets sites online and in front of customers faster than has ever been possible.
