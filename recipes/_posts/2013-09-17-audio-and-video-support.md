Video promotion is over __6 times more effective__ than print and online<sub><a target="_blank" href="http://www.b2bmarketing.net/blog/posts/2013/06/06/25-stats-marketers-should-know-about-video">[1]</a></sub> so we thought it was about time to support it on CloudCannon. We've always supported video hosted on YouTube and Vimeo but now you can host video and audio on your own website and have __complete control__ of the experience for your users. One thing to note is we treat .ogg as audio files, if you want a video .ogg file rename the extension to .ogv.

The file browser has also been upgraded so you can preview video, audio and font files.
