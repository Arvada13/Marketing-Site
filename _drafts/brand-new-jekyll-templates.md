Jekyll is often pigeon-holed as this tool for developers to write their blog. This is just one of the many great uses of Jekyll. We're always interested in exploring interesting, unconventional use cases of Jekyll. Today we have three new templates that do exactly that:

## [Aviator](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/templates/aviator/)

![Aviator template](/images/blog/brand-new-jekyll-templates/aviator.jpg){:class="screenshot"}

## [Author](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/templates/author/)

![Author template](/images/blog/brand-new-jekyll-templates/author.jpg){:class="screenshot"}

## [Aperture](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/templates/aperture/)

![Aperture template](/images/blog/brand-new-jekyll-templates/aperture.jpg){:class="screenshot"}

## Usage

To use the new templates in CloudCannon, create a new site and select the **Choose a Template** option.

![Choose a jekyll template](/images/blog/7-free-jekyll-templates/choose.jpeg){:class="screenshot"}

From here you can browse through the templates and select your favourite.

These templates also work without CloudCannon, just fork the template repository on GitHub or download a zip.

## What's Next?

We have more Jekyll templates in the works. If there's a use case a Jekyll template would help you solve let us know in the comments below.
