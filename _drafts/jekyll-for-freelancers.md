Jekyll is a fantastic tool for freelancers building websites for clients. Compared to a CMS like WordPress there's a number of advantages:

* **Simplicity** - There's no complex templating or plugins you need to understand. Building a Jekyll site is similar to building a purely static website.
* **Maintenance** - You don't need to worry about updating CMS software or plugins. Jekyll outputs a static website which are significantly faster, secure and stable than a typical WordPress setup.
* **Backups**- Jekyll sites are typically connected to a Git repository which is used to undo unwanted changes by a client and as a full backup of all the files on the site.&nbsp;

With a Jekyll CMS like [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com), you can have all these advantages&nbsp;**and** have an easy-to-use interface for clients to update content. In this post we're going over tips for freelancers to get the most out of CloudCannon.

## Client Sharing

[Client Sharing](https://docs.cloudcannon.com/sharing/client-sharing/)&nbsp;is a CloudCannon feature specifically for freelancers/agencies. Instead of each client needing their own CloudCannon account, you can set up a Client Sharing password in *Site Settings /&nbsp;Client Sharing.* Clients can then go to https://theirwebsite.com/update/ and enter the password. This gives them full access to update content on their site.
