We have exciting updates for CloudCannon including new pricing, new UI and brand new features.
## Pricing

We’ve learned a lot about how people are using CloudCannon and realised we could do a better job on how we price CloudCannon.

We’ve changed our pricing to fit with the way you’re using CloudCannon. Our new plans have unlimited websites, white labeling for agencies and advanced features for enterprises.<!-- Pricing Plans -->

CloudCannon now charges per user instead of per website. For example, say you’re a design agency with three people on the team looking to use CloudCannon. You’d select your desired pricing tier, then share your to those the rest of your team. You'll be charged for each user you've shared with. You can then create more sites and share them with your team at no extra charge. [Client Sharing](http://docs.cloudcannon.com/sharing/client-sharing/) does not require count as a user so you can share a site with smaller clients at no additional cost.

If you’re on an existing pricing plan you have the option to upgrade to our new pricing at any time in Account Settings.

## New Agency Features

* [White labeling](h) - Brand CloudCannon as your own when you’re sharing to clients using [client sharing](http://docs.cloudcannon.com/sharing/client-sharing/).

## New Enterprise Features

Enterprises have access to new features including:

* [Geolocation](http://docs.cloudcannon.com/i18n/geolocation/) - change content depending on where the visitor is located.
* [Internationalisation](http://docs.cloudcannon.com/i18n/internationalisation/) - translate your site into multiple languages.
* [SAML authentication](http://docs.cloudcannon.com/authentication/saml/) - Use One Login or other single sign on provider to restrict access to your site.

## New UI

You’ll also notice a brand new UI in CloudCannon. We constantly strive to make CloudCannon even easier for everyone to use. This latest iteration fixes many of the usability issues we’ve seen crop up.<!-- Screenshot --><!-- Screenshot -->

## Front Matter UI

The Jekyll has come a long way since launching a few months ago. We recently added the ability to have complety control over the UI displayed when front matter is editing. Now you can have date fields, check boxes, select boxes and more.
