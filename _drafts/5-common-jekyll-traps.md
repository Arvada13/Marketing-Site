    text: Porting WordPress content over. Luckily there are/were a number of open-source tools to help me, but it wasn’t necessarily simple, and brought a fairly long-tail of legacy with it (code blocks incorrectly formatted, WP meta data being crammed into Jekyll’s YML front matter).

    text: With over 1,000 blog posts on my site when I moved from WordPress to Jekyll, it takes some time to generate my site. That was a minor annoyance which has gotten better over the years with faster computers and more performant Jekyll updates.

  johan:
    text: The setup is kind of hard with the ruby dependencies/rvm/gemfiles/gem bundles. Now there are some decent guides I guess but when I was starting there was no solid guide to explain how it worked, there was a lot of assumed knowledge from being a Ruby developer even though I used Jekyll as a web designer. Setting Jekyll up in Windows is also painful on its own (I don't use Windows primarily but used Jekyll in a coding workshop I gave, not everyone has a Mac)

  travis:
    text: Using Jekyll was the first time I had to use the terminal. I am a designer first, and that tends to scare our kind, but its no so bad. Another thing was trying to get my dev environment perfect. But now Jekyll handles SASS and there is an adequate Jade plugin. Still no live-reload without going to gulp/grunt route, and compile times could be faster.

    text: I haven't run into any major hurdles lately, most of the growing pains came from just trying to get a firm grasp on the basics.  Does Jekyll process a page through Markdown or Liquid first?  Why can't I use Liquid tags in excerpts?  Why can't I specify a permalink in my blog index front-matter?  The documentation for Jekyll is great, but some things just need to be learned through experimentation.

    text: Well, there's Jekyll, and then there's Github Pages Jekyll. Jekyll itself is pretty straightforward, but Github Pages doesn't have great error messaging on build fail. It has gotten a bit better over the years, but still... Jekyll itself was pretty easy to work with once you figured out the basic config setup (which, if you've never used a config file before, takes a little learning, but not too bad).

I recently reached out to a number of people that I consider to be Jekyll influencers. These guys aren&#39;t the core contributing team, but rather users like you and me passionate enough and vocal enough to contribute code snippets,&nbsp;write about their experience of using Jekyll or open source themes to the community.

I asked these influencers to share some of their opinions and experiences of what they love about Jekyll, what makes them facepalm, and where they would like to see Jekyll and it&#39;s community headed.

The response I had was awesome and I&#39;ve decided to share my findings in a 3 part blog series.

My second question was "what was the first roadblock/hurdle/facepalm moment you had to overcome to begin using Jekyll?"

#### The TL;DR:

Top 5 most common Jekyll hurdles (to push on through!):

1. Initial setup is a pain (getting dev environment just right)
2. Understanding site structure
3. Windows support is not there
4. Compile speed
5. GUI lacking (CLI scares some users)

#### In their own words:

{% include /quote.html quote=page.quotes.dave%}

{% include /quote.html quote=page.quotes.mike%}

{% include /quote.html quote=page.quotes.anon1%}

#### If I may generalise even further:

It would seem to me that those 5 most common answers for loving Jekyll are really subsets of two larger comforts for developers:

1. You can understand what&#39;s happening - HTML + CSS/SASS + Markdown get fed in and compiled, and those components themselves are easy to manipulate with minimal new learning.That gives you power and confidence.  
2. You love what gets spit out - static site files that are extremely easy to handle: speed, security, stability are all amazing.

Understanding Predictability cannot be overvalued for developer peace of mind!

Join me next week when I&#39;ll be sharing some common traps that these Jekyll users have had to overcome.
