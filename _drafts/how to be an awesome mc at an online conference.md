Last weekend I was part of JekyllConf, a free online conference for the Jekyll static site generator community.

I was on the organising team from day one and it was great to see our idea for the conference, and the Google Hangout on Air + Twitter format we delivered it in, come to fruition.

Nerve-wrackingly and excitingly I was also the MC for the day.

I said I&#39;d do it because I love public speaking. I find&nbsp;it a huge rush even though (and maybe because) the fear and the butterflies never go away,

In the days leading up to the conference I was feeling a little overwhelmed and under prepared for the MC responsibility. I was going to be the public face of the conference after all.

I took some time to think about what I was really adding to the conference and then how could I make sure I did a great job of fulfilling that role.

### Here&#39;s the key tasks I came up with:

1.  Generate excitement for speakers.
2.  Be the audience.
3.  Add a dash of professionalism.

Once I had those key roles in mind I was able to a much better job of preparing.

### Here&#39;s what I did...

#### 1. Generate excitement for the speakers.

When most people think of an MC at an event, they often remember the work they do introducing speakers and making announcements. This is really important. Not just to let people know what&#39;s going on, but to answer this question&nbsp;- why should I care?

A great intro can make a great speaker even more engaging in the eyes of your audience. It also helps the audience stay with a speaker who gets off to a rough start.

Whether your conference is offline and paid or online and free, your audience is always paying with their time and attention.

Given the conference team went to the effort of organising the speaker, you owe it to the sepaker&nbsp;to help keep the audience interested in hearing them, and you owe it to the audience to help them not miss any talk gems.

If, like me, you may end up staring at the speaker list the day before the event and think:&nbsp;&quot;Hot damn!&nbsp;How am I going to introduce all these speakers? I&#39;ve never even met all/half/any of them!&quot;

But don&#39;t fear. I&#39;ll help you figure out a little system you can use to build your intros.

Here&#39;s the intro skeleton I decided I would use for JekyllConf:

*   **Where is this&nbsp;speaker talking from?**
*   **Where does this&nbsp;speaker work&nbsp;currently?**
*   **Where has the&nbsp;speaker&nbsp;worked previously**
*   **&nbsp;Why is the&nbsp;speaker relevant to the conference and/or why I am (as part of the conference team and MC and attendee)&nbsp;excited to hear from them?**

The first three points build context. People like context.

**Where the speaker is talking from:** Although simple, this serves a specific purpose for JekyllConf - we wanted to reinforce the idea that the community is spread widely, but has decided to come together for the conference day. Also, our speakers are giving up time in their normal lives and they deserve respect and acknowledgement for that.

**Where a speaker was remoting from: **This&nbsp;was not written down before we went live, but our green room team also had the &#39;Speaker Intro&#39; google doc open and would fill it out as the speakers came into the green room and they chatted.

**Where the speaker works currently:** For JekyllConf most people&#39;s jobs are relevant to the subject matter. It&#39;s an IT conference about tools to use in your work, by speakers who use those tools in their work. It&#39;s reinforcing of their authority to be listened to, and establishes context for the work environment they might be talking about.

This info is really easy to find. 7 out of our 8 speakers had a LinkedIn page that you could pull this info off of. The 8th had a good &#39;about&#39; section on his personal website.

**Where they have worked previously:** Further reinforces point two a little, can be interesting and it&#39;s a bit of filler. Again, pull this info off of LinkedIn or personal websites.

**Why the speaker is relevant to the conference and/or why you are excited to hear from them:** Here&#39;s the only really hard piece of the intro. But it&#39;s not even that difficult. If you were involved in the speaker selection process, why did you say yes to this speaker? What do they add to the conference? If you weren&#39;t on the selection panel, ask someone who was.

For JekyllConf we set our speaker schedule so we had a speaker story arc that went something like this:

Speaker order:

1.  Establish context of Jekyll
2.  Interesting use case of Jekyll
3.  Recognisable company that is supporting Jekyll
4.  Quirky talk from intersting, relevant Jekyll personality
5.  Really detailed/technical look at how Jekyll is being built
6.  A &#39;how to&#39; talk for attendees using Jekyll in govt/enterprise environment
7.  New tool being developed that might be relevant to some in the Jekyll ecosystem
8.  Authorative personality from Jekyll community for announcements and parting thoughts

If you know why a speaker was chosen you can **tell your audience,&nbsp;rather than let them figure it out for themselves.** It helps to match expectations with what is going to be delivered.

Using this framework and a little research on Twitter, LinkedIn and personal websites I was able to put together meaningful, interesting intros that I was happy with relatively quickly.

In a few cases I where I had previously met the speaker in person or communicated at length via email I was able to add a more personal anecdote, but this was always in the context of reinforcing speaker context, relevance or awesomeness.

#### 2. Be the audience

In our conference format&nbsp;I probably spoke for a total of 15 minutes over the course of 6 hours.

But I had to be on point and attentive the whole time.

There were more than 100 people listening to our speakers at any one time during our live broadcast, but only three of us in the hangout.

Having run remote seminars/talks for trainings before&nbsp;I have found that speakers find talking with no audience response extremely disconcerting. So, it is the MC&#39;s job to provide any feedback that may be required if there is no actual audience interaction. It&#39;s often as simple as a nod and a smile, or a confirmation that &#39;yes&#39; your slides are sharing correctly and I&#39;m seeing what you are seeing.

But, you have to be available to help at any time so this can amount to be a draining task.

The most crucial interaction in our conference format was the question time at the end of a speaker session.

Presenting questions asked by audience members is one of the few critical elements that raises a Hangout on Air from a glorified phone call to a community event.&nbsp;Audience members have a chance to engage in the discussion. And they feel part of it given they can&#39;t speak themselves.

And yet, despite 100 watchers and numerous prompts for questions to be posted in the conference Twitter stream, sometimes you end up with no questions&nbsp;after a 30 minute talk.

I believe it is disrespectful and disheartening for the speaker to feel that their talk has not generated any questions or comment. So it is the MC&#39;s job to engage in this discussion.

While I am listening I am constantly writing down potential questions. I will admit, some of these are not great questions, especially when you the MC probably know far less about the topic than your speaker, but it is often easy to hear/perceive where a speaker has had to gloss over aspects in their talk that they would rather have elaborated on. It is also easy and relevant material to link the current speaker&#39;s topic back to talks heard earlier in the day.

You the MC, play an important role in the narrative that runs throughout the entire conference.

#### 3. Add a dash of professionalism

If we are being honest, Hangouts on Air is little more than a normal Google hangout and a couple of floating heads with headphones on, talking to each other. For better or worse our conference format&nbsp;lacks a little of the ceremony at a traditional conference.

Just as the MC is the audience to the speaker, I feel that the MC is the &#39;conference&#39; to the audience.

You are the constant point of reference through a changing lineup. What weapons do you have at your disposal?

I think these are:

*   How you interact
*   How you look, and
*   How you sound.

How you interact we&#39;ve covered above.

But how you look and how you sound are equally important.

**How you look.**

Rhetorical question:

Which online event did this awesome speaker present at?

You&#39;d probably never guess if you weren&#39;t there.

Which online event did was this guy a part of?

![](/uploads/versions/screen shot 2015-05-07 at 11.54.19 am---&#40;----958-512&#41;---.png)JekyllConf baby!

A last minute decision but one I am certainly glad I made was to produce the JekyllConf backdrop.

The backdrop adds a strong, constant, visual element to what could have been a long day of lounge, bedroom, and office walls.

For the audience it is also reassuring that every time the camera cuts back to me that,&nbsp;yes, they are still in the right place!

A backdrop takes a little effort, and a lot of blutacking but my vote is that it&#39;s definitely worth it.

Here&#39;s my actual setup:

![](/uploads/versions/2015-05-02 16.37.17---&#40;----3264-2448&#41;---.jpg)

**Sounding great:**

I&#39;m lucky that I have some reasonable microphones for recording guitar lying around at home. The difference in audio quality is noticeable.

Yes the event would have still run smoothly had I used the microphone on my Apple headphones, but I think you want to show you&#39;ve put in a little effort. Accessories like this&nbsp;say&nbsp;that this is a community EVENT and not something we cooked up yesterday.

I also think a nice mic can add a strong visual presence. I could have hidden mine off camera but it looks like I take my recording seriously and I was even able to have some fun with conference branding on it (yes, that&#39;s simply a piece of paper blutacked onto it).

The little things, doth the conference make.

### In conclusion

If you have the opportunity to MC an online conference, awesome, congratulations to you. Someone thinks you have an important set of skills to add to the atmosphere of the event.

Enjoy it.  

Remember though that you are a key part of the conference day&nbsp;and it&#39;s not a role to be undertaken without a little forethought.

Choose to be awesome and I&#39;m sure you will be.
