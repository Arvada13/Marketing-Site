CloudCannon&#39;s support for the Jekyll static site generator has moved from private to public beta.

### What does this mean for you?

Jekyll is a useful tool for building static sites as it allows website creators to add more powerful site functionality that would normally only work in dynamic sites, like blogs and galleries.

All users on CloudCannon now have access to our Jekyll features.

The key features are:

*   Cloud-based Jekyll site compiling (a benefit for designers and developers)
*   Easy to use client interfaces for creating and editing the content (blog posts, photos, menus, etc) in their Jekyll powered website. Editors won&#39;t have to understand Markdown or front matter to make Jekyll site content contributions.

### Video overviews

This 3 minute video offers a quick overview of Jekyll on CloudCannon.

_Comments about contacting us to join the beta obviously no longer apply :)_

The longer video of the public beta announcement and demonstration by our CEO at the recent [JekyllConf](http://JekyllConf.com) is also available below.

### Should I put my professional and client projects on your Jekyll functionality that is still in beta?

Our Jekyll support features are stable. Sites compile and the client editing interfaces function as they should.

The public beta status of our Jekyll support reflects the fact that we still have better documentation we want to write and we are likely to continue making improvements to the user interfaces.

The CloudCannon site and our documentation website already run on CloudCannon using Jekyll.

### Open office hours planned

To assist you in getting started with Jekyll we are scheduling a drop-in &#39;office hours&#39; session this week via Google Hangout. This will take place on Thursday 14th May at:
