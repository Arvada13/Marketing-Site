Over the last couple weeks we have released some big changes.

### Editables everywhere

Before editable elements needed to be in the base html page. Now editable elements can be in any layout or include. Update sidebars, headers and footers across many pages in the visual editor. CloudCannon will detect where the editables came from then update the relevant files.&nbsp;Give it a try by adding `class="editable"` in an include or layout.

### Better Navigation

Navigation and routing has been cleaned up every in the app. We removed the ugly hash that was in the url and changed that to a path everyone can understand. Refactored&nbsp;developer views have are all available&nbsp;under the browser namespace. Easy to use breadcrumbs inside the code view have been added to transition back to the parent folders.

The Collection view got a similar refresh with a neat breadcrumb and nicer url.

The visual editor has had the biggest change. URLs use the output url which allows you to view all pages to within the app. The title of the page replaces the breadcrumb. We removed the preview option as you can now navigate links inside editables. To preview, keep your mouse still and the yellow boxes go away.

Across all three of these sections we have changed the view toggle to a view change. The current state will no longer be visible to keep the number of buttons down.

### New Link Editor

Adding and updating links is an essential part of CloudCannon and&nbsp;needed a refresh. The new link editor:

* Has the option to link to a page
* Removes the ability to link to the source HTML and MD&nbsp;files
* Allows navigating&nbsp;to the current link
* Is consistent with the image editor controls

### Case studies

We recently interviewed a few of our power users to see how it was working for them. [Netflix](/customers/netflix/), [Engine Yard](/customers/engine-yard/), [Xtendly](/customers/xtendly/) and [Brandon Setter](/customers/brandon-setter/) all had great things to say about the system.&nbsp;

Many of these changes are based on suggestions. You can make a suggestion by contacting us in the app or at [support@cloudcannon.com](mailto:support@cloudcannon.com). Good or bad, let us know what you think.
