In this series we're comparing traditional backend Content Management Systems with a static approach of Jekyll and CloudCannon. We'll take this free material design theme from Google and implement it using these two content management systems.

## Site Overview

The site is a basic material design blog template. The home page lists all the blog posts:

![](/uploads/versions/home---x----900-563x---.jpg){:screenshot}
There's an about page:
![](/uploads/versions/screen-shot-2015-09-23-at-2.40.19-pm---x----900-563x---.png){:screenshot}
And a page to view a blog post:
![](/uploads/versions/screen-shot-2015-09-23-at-2.38.07-pm---x----900-563x---.png){:screenshot}

## Setup

Let's start with setting up Drupal.

I'm on Mac OSX so I decided to use [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) to set up my PHP environment. After a 240MB download I had a full PHP with MySQL environment ready to go. Next I downloaded Drupal 7.39, put it in my htdocs directory and loaded the quick installer in my browser.

Now let's look at Jekyll. I'm using Mac OSX so Ruby is already installed. To install Jekyll I open up my terminal and type:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo gem install jekyll
{% endhighlight %}
