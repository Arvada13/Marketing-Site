  michael:
    text: "As a theme developer I get a lot of feedback from Jekyll users. The ones I hear from the most are generally non-devs who gravitate to Jekyll because of the free hosting GitHub Pages provides. From their comments there definitely is a void to fill in providing a service that makes working with Jekyll easier. Whether that's something like prose.io, a GUI wrapper for those who fear the CLI, or just making it easier to get it installed and running on their system.\n\nAs far as features for Jekyll it seems to be moving in the right direction with 3.0. I have a fairly large Jekyll site and it takes forever to build, so anything to improve performance there has my vote. With the incremental rebuild stuff the Jekyll core team is working on hopefully that will be a non-issue."

I am guessing your business model will mostly be managing the Jekyll engine, and letting people submit content in an easy way- thus locally installing Jekyll isn't on your radar. That said, I truly believe that a standalone installer for Jekyll is needed to open it out to people unable to find their way through installing and managing gems just to get up and running.\n\nThere is Omnibus Jekyll [1], a standalone installer for Jekyll and dependencies, but work on that is slow and not currently the main focus of the Jekyll developers.\n\n[1] https://github.com/jekyll/omnibus-jekyll"

I don't do that anymore and am not sure it's needed. (Did it to keep full deployments smaller)\n\n---\n\nI should point out that I'm about to move away from Jekyll to build a dynamic site.

I recently reached out to people that I consider to be influencers in the Jekyll community. I asked them to share their opinions and experiences of Jekyll.

I asked them what problems they encountered when they first started using Jekyll. I have some suggestions on where to look for help if you are stuck. <!-- excerpt stop -->

I recently reached out to people that I consider to be influencers in the Jekyll community. I asked them to share their opinions and experiences of Jekyll. First they shared their top [5 reasons to love Jekyll](http://cloudcannon.com/jekyll/2015/03/04/5-reasons-you-should-use-jekyll.html) and last week I looked at their top [5 traps for Jekyll beginners](http://cloudcannon.com/jekyll/2015/03/13/5-common-jekyll-traps.html).

Jekyll is the most popular static site generator on the web by most measures. It's a tool and a community in a growth spurt.

With that in mind I want to round off this series of Jekyll blog posts by exploring how the *current* influencers hope the product and community will continue to develop in the future.

If you want to contribute to Jekyll in some way going forward, consider that these areas of code and content are in demand by the community!

A growing base of knowledgeable users can only be good for Jekyll.

The final big survey question I put to my influencers was **&quot;What is Jekyll and/or it's community currently missing?&quot;**

#### The TL;DR:

Top 6 Jekyll contribution gaps *you* can fill as identifed by the Jekyll community:

1.  Evangelists
2.  Tutorials
3.  Advanced Documentation
4.  Themes
5.  GUI
6.  Compile Speed

#### Breaking it down.

1. Evangelists

#### In their own words:

**&quot;What was the first roadblock/hurdle/facepalm moment you had to overcome to begin using Jekyll?&quot;**

#### Plug from CloudCannon:

Avoid the initial Jekyll environment setup by moving your compilation to the cloud. Add non-tech friendly GUIs to your Jekyll workflow. Check out [CloudCannon&#39;s Jekyll beta overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjd0V_pET5E) and then [join the beta](http://app.cloudcannon.com/jekyll_beta).
