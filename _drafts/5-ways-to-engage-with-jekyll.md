  michael:
    text: "As a theme developer I get a lot of feedback from Jekyll users. The ones I hear from the most are generally non-devs who gravitate to Jekyll because of the free hosting GitHub Pages provides. From their comments there definitely is a void to fill in providing a service that makes working with Jekyll easier. Whether that's something like prose.io, a GUI wrapper for those who fear the CLI, or just making it easier to get it installed and running on their system.\n\nAs far as features for Jekyll it seems to be moving in the right direction with 3.0. I have a fairly large Jekyll site and it takes forever to build, so anything to improve performance there has my vote. With the incremental rebuild stuff the Jekyll core team is working on hopefully that will be a non-issue."

I am guessing your business model will mostly be managing the Jekyll engine, and letting people submit content in an easy way- thus locally installing Jekyll isn't on your radar. That said, I truly believe that a standalone installer for Jekyll is needed to open it out to people unable to find their way through installing and managing gems just to get up and running.\n\nThere is Omnibus Jekyll [1], a standalone installer for Jekyll and dependencies, but work on that is slow and not currently the main focus of the Jekyll developers.\n\n[1] https://github.com/jekyll/omnibus-jekyll"

I recently reached out to people that I consider to be influencers in the Jekyll community. I asked them to share their opinions and experiences of Jekyll.

I asked them what problems they encountered when they first started using Jekyll. I have some suggestions on where to look for help if you are stuck. <!-- excerpt stop -->

I recently reached out to people that I consider to be influencers in the Jekyll community. I asked them to share their opinions and experiences of Jekyll. Last week I shared their top [5 most common reasons for loving Jekyll](http://cloudcannon.com/jekyll/2015/03/04/5-reasons-you-should-use-jekyll.html).

The natural follow up question to &#39;what works?&#39; is &#39;what doesn&#39;t?&#39;. But I didn&#39;t want to ask that question - it&#39;s rather un-constructive. Instead I think new users might be more encouraged to hear the initial hurdles other users have overcome to get started. If they can overcome their&#39;s so might you Jekyll padawan!

So without further ado*...

*and remembering that some users began years ago and the Jekyll dev&#39;s have been doing a great job of fixing these issues or [have plans to](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/3324).

My second big survey question was **&quot;What was the first roadblock/hurdle/facepalm moment you had to overcome to begin using Jekyll?&quot;**

#### The TL;DR:

Top 5 most common Jekyll hurdles starting out:

1.  Initial setup is a pain (getting dev environment just right)
2.  Understanding site structure
3.  Windows support
4.  Compile speed
5.  GUI lacking (command line interface scares some users)

#### Help for getting through these initial Jekyll issues:

Identifying shared initial frustrations with Jekyll might make you feel better about encountering them. Better than a problem shared though is a problem solved! Below is a collection of info on identified issues:

**Initial setup is a pain (getting dev environment just right)**

1.  The Jekyll Core Team is putting lots of effort into making local installs easier. [Have your say on a solution](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/poll-installation-priorities-for-3-0/106)
2.  Watch Travis Neilson&#39;s [AWESOME intro video for local installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWowJBRMtpc).
3.  Move your compile to the cloud. See CloudCannon notes below.

**Understanding site structure**

1.  The [Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) do cover this well so give them another read.
2.  Andrew Munsell&#39;s [Jekyll by Example](https://www.andrewmunsell.com/tutorials/jekyll-by-example/tutorial) tutorial gives a great overview of concepts in action.
3.  _Another alternative for a fully explained build is the older [Yes We Jekyll](http://yeswejekyll.com/). (16/3 suggested by @parkr)_
4.  _If the powerful &#39;collections&#39; feature is confusing you&nbsp;check out this&nbsp;recent guide by @BenBalter:&nbsp;[Explain like I&rsquo;m five: Jekyll collections](http://ben.balter.com/2015/02/20/jekyll-collections/).&nbsp;(16/3&nbsp;great&nbsp;suggestion by @AlWillis)_

**Windows support**

1.  This is the [official-unofficial guide by @juthilo](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/)

**Compile speed**

1.  Not a lot of quick wins available here at the moment, but it has been and is a top priority for the Jekyll Core Team. In fact in the [latest Jekyll 3.0.0 beta release notes](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/v3.0.0.beta1/History.markdown#head) incremental regeneration is item number one.

**GUI lacking (command line interface scares some users)**

1.  [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) is a solution that some Jekyll users have turned to to assist with editing markdown and the publishing process.
2.  CloudCannon is looking to nail this! See below.

#### In their own words:

**&quot;What was the first roadblock/hurdle/facepalm moment you had to overcome to begin using Jekyll?&quot;**

#### Plug from CloudCannon:

Avoid the initial Jekyll environment setup by moving your compilation to the cloud. Add non-tech friendly GUIs to your Jekyll workflow. Check out [CloudCannon&#39;s Jekyll beta overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjd0V_pET5E) and then [join the beta](http://app.cloudcannon.com/jekyll_beta).
