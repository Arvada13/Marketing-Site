One of the reasons I love using Jekyll is my entire site can live in Git. With Git I can rollback to any previous version of my site, backup my repository to an offsite location and have collaboration workflows for working with other developers. Developers understand and are empowered by Git but what about a non-technical editors?&nbsp;

Our main goal at CloudCannon is to bring all the advantages of these developer technologies to non-technical editors. To an extent we've achieved this with editing a Jekyll site; Editors can update HTML, Markdown, front matter, blog posts, collections and data files without knowing anything about Jekyll or HTML. Recently we've been working to achieve the same thing for Git workflows.&nbsp;
