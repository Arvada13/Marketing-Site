		<!--h1>CloudCannon is a new kind of CMS for the static site generator, Jekyll.</h1> -->
		<h2>What drives us</h2>
		<p>Our mission is to bring all the advantages of static technology to developers while giving editors intuitive interfaces and workflows to update content. We believe most informational websites should be static. The reason theyâ€™re not is non-technical editors need to update content.</p>
