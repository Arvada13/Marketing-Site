		<h2 id="bounty-policy">Bug Bounty Policy</h2>
		<h4>Bounty Qualification</h4>
		<p>Only critical vulnerabilities that demonstrate complete compromise of the system's integrity or confidentiality are eligible for a bounty. While we encourage you to submit all potential issues, lower severity issues are not in scope at this time.</p>
		<p>It's important to keep in mind that not all submissions will qualify for a bounty, and that the decision to award a bounty is entirely at the discretion of CloudCannon. CloudCannon have final decision on which issues constitute security vulnerabilities.</p>

		<h4>Disclosure Policy</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue, and we'll make every effort to quickly resolve the issue. </li>
			<li>Do not make any information public until the issue has been resolved.</li>
			<li>Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service.</li>
			<li>Do not access or modify data that does not belong to you - create a free account to test with.</li>
			<li>Making many substantially similar reports will only be eligible for one bounty award, and marked as duplicate. For example, the same vulnerability reported across multiple subdomains. Please consolidate issues into a single report.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Exclusions</h4>
		<p>While researching, we'd like to ask you to refrain from:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Denial of service </li>
			<li>Spamming </li>
			<li>Social engineering (including phishing) of CloudCannon staff or contractors </li>
			<li>Any physical attempts against CloudCannon property or data centers </li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Safe Harbor</h4>
		<p>Any activities conducted in a manner consistent with this policy will be considered authorized conduct and we will not initiate legal action against you. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you in connection with activities conducted under this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.</p> 
		<p>Thank you for helping keep CloudCannon and our users safe!</p>
