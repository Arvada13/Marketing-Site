  - heading: Your Jekyll build fully automated
    text: Have complete control over how your Jekyll site builds.
    icon: under-construction
  - heading: Your Jekyll environment in the cloud
    text: Replicate your local environment in the cloud. On every commit CloudCannon installs your Gemfile, builds your site and pushes it to the CMS and hosting.
    icon: air-support
  - heading: A build to match your requirements
    text: Push the boundaries of what Jekyll is capable of by installing Jekyll plugins or writing your own. CloudCannon runs your build in a sandboxed environment so you’re safe to run your own code.

  - heading: Automatic asset compression
    text: Squeeze every ounce of performance out of your site without having to lift a finger. CloudCannon automatically minifies your CSS and JavaScript to make sure your site loads snappy for visitors.
    icon: file-bundle
  - heading: Customise your build for different environments
    text: With environment variables you can use different values on your website depending on the environment. For example you might serve assets locally on your staging environment but from a CDN on production.

  - heading: Scheduling
    text: Do you have content that needs to go live at 2am? Get a good night sleep by using scheduling to publish content at a future point in time. 
    icon: time-management
  - heading: Multiple sites made easy
    text: Share your layout, CSS, Javascript and other assets across multiple sites to ensure they’re consistent and easy to maintain. Jekyll themes make managing multiple sites with a similar layout a breeze.
