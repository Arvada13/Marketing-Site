question: How am I billed when adding new users?
answer_markdown: >-
  CloudCannon adds a prorated charge (or refund when removing a user) to your
  next invoice. For example, if your team is on the **Basic** plan, it costs $25
  per user per month. You add a new team member 10 days into your billing period
  and there are 20 remaining days in the month. The per-day cost for each user
  is $25 รท 30, so we add on $16.66 ($25 รท 30 days ร 20 days) to your next
  invoice.
