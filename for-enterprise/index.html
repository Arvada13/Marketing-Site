	    <p>CloudCannon simplifies the process of building and managing marketing websites.</p>
	    <p>Whether it’s updating the company blog or launching new websites to support new campaigns and products, marketing teams are constantly under pressure to publish new content to the web, and fast.</p>
	    
	    <h4>Simplifying sites, but not at the expense of features</h4>
	        <p>Static websites are the best choice for marketing teams to use. Static sites are fast, stable, secure and scalable. They are also straightforward for developers to create.</p>
	        <p>The power of static site generator Jekyll means there are few cases where a static website cannot deliver the functionality of dynamic websites with traditional CMS’s that marketing teams may be used to.</p>
	        
        <h4>Building as a team</h4>
            <p>In teams where content creators currently pass all new website content to developers to publish, developers can quickly feel like a bottleneck.</p>
            <p>CloudCannon allows developers in marketing teams to empower their team members to contribute and publish content without developer intervention. Marketers don't need to understand Markdown or git to use CloudCannon.</p>
            <p>Best of all, changes can be seen instantly in a live test-website environment.</p>

        <h4>Simple site management</h4>
            <p>The CloudCannon dashboard lets enterprise developers manage multiple websites easily.</p>
