We’ve been so busy the past month I haven’t had a chance to update this blog. That’s all changing now, there's too much going on here not to share. I'm going to spend more time keeping you updated with all the exciting things happening at CloudCannon.

The first big announcement is we’ve joined a New Zealand based business accelerator programme called [Lightning Lab](http://lightninglab.co.nz). 

George and I originally built CloudCannon to solve our own problem... it just shouldn’t be that hard to get a simple website online. Six months later we’ve found thousands of web designers share our vision and are using CloudCannon everyday. 

Lightning Lab is going to help us grow so we can provide you with an even more powerful service. We’re stoked to be here and can’t wait to show you what we've got in the pipeline.

Exciting times!
