We’ve had a big week at CloudCannon and I’m very happy to announce new pricing tiers for CloudCannon.

Until now we’ve had single price per production website on CloudCannon. George and I sat down and talked to you guys to see if the pricing was working for you. One thing soon became obvious, it wasn’t.

Web designers are building their web design companies around CloudCannon and the current pricing model wasn’t scaling with their business.

Well, we listened and today we’re fixing that with new pricing tiers.

## What are the tiers? ##

We’re introducing four pricing tiers to work with you at all stages of growing your business from building your first website to running a thriving web design agency.

We found there was a lot of confusion between a "prototyping" cloudvent.net address and a production domain. Now the number of sites is much simpler, it's the number of websites you have whether they're cloudvent.net addresses or production domains.

Don't worry, we still have a free plan but it's now a single cloudvent.net site to give you a taste of CloudCannon.

## What’s Next? ##
CloudCannon makes it really easy for you to get websites online for you clients. Now it’s time to take things further.

Over the next few months we’re focusing on:

* Making it easier to work in teams on CloudCannon websites
* We’ve made websites load super fast already. We want to make them load even faster.
* Adding more power for you guys to create more complex websites on CloudCannon
* Simplifying the client experience even more
