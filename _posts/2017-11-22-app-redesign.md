Today we released our rebranding across our app. This includes a large number of usability fixes. Below are the most notable changes:

## Organisation Branding

The new design is developed from the ground up to make it your own. We have made the entire app colour scheme configurable with assets to match. We recommend using our uploading SVG icons to make your teams experience extra crisp.

SCREENSHOT OF BRANDING INTERFACE WITH DIFFERENT COLOR

Branding also effects the client sharing interface. For personal accounts only the colour and brand logo are configurable.

## User Menu

We have moved the user settings into a dropdown which is accessible from the bottom left corner. Click the face to access all the options including a new quick select for swapping organisations.

## Status & Reports

The old site status page is no more. **Status** has been moved to the top right corner on every site view. This makes build, sync and optimise status easy to check from editor views. This is consistent for the stripped down client interface status. In the sidebar, **Status** has been renamed to **Reports** to more accurately reflect the remaining views.

## Explore & Edit

**Collections** is a great label for Jekyll developers but not so good otherwise. We have renamed this view to **Explore** which has undergone some minor adjustments. Output collections are now grouped with standalone pages. All other collections are grouped in a data section.

**Editor** has been shortened to the verb form of **Edit** to inspire action.

## Visual Editing

When editing your website we believe the experience should mimic viewing it. The new editor modes are aimed to be distraction free and immersive. When clicking on an editor mode, the content pane will cover the entire width of the screen. To navigate back, the icon in the top left will be replaced with menu icon (either a map or folder icon). Clicking the icon will open the appropriate navigation for the previously opened page. This change is part of an on going effort offer more visual editing options.
