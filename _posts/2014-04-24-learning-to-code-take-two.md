So for a while there after my first go at coding html with the help of Codecademy’s awesome tutorials I was on a bit of ego high, because I made text change colours, I linked words to images, added images from different websites, made lists with different background colours and heaps of other exciting stuff which I had always presumed was super hard. 

Then my egotistic bubble got burst. Big time. Because I found out that CloudCannon co-founder George made his first website when he was seven. SEVEN! What. And then other developer friends started reminiscing about how they’d made their first sites at nine, ten, eleven years old. And here I am at twenty-one years old overly proud of accomplishing something that a seven year old can do. I guess I must just be a late developer.

And thus began my second attempt at learning html. I was pretty determined to whip through loads of tutorials this time around to prove that I was as good as any primary aged child out there, but to my dismay I could remember hardly anything from last time (this was about a week and a half later). I vaguely remembered, but not exactly, and you have to be pretty exact with html. So I went back through every tutorial I did last time in order to refresh my memory, though much, much faster.

I also made another super sweet webpage or ‘social media profile’ which helped me revive and refine my former skills, but was a bit frustrated at that I hadn’t yet been taught how to centre align images because that could’ve made my profile look waaay better. Also frustrating was not knowing what colour is what and what font families are available. I mean I know if I type in ‘pink’ the font will be pink but how do you change the shade of pink? From what I understand, every colour has a unique code that you can type in instead of just typing the name but how do you find what a colour’s code is? And how can you choose the perfect colour shade without a slider to give variation. Do you always have to pre-determine your colour before you do the code? When you make the file in Photoshop? I guess that makes sense actually. I believe I’ve just answered my own question. 

Disclaimer: Unsure if my theory is correct so don’t quote me on that, I will have to double check with someone who knows their shit.
 
Last but not least, in the html basics tutorial was the making of Tables. This felt quite similar to making lists a.k.a. sorta feel like I wouldn’t use them but they are probably used all time. Felt a bit like Codecademy suddenly dumped loads of new words on me like <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> without really giving me the chance to repeat them a bit, and then master them. Not too sure if I will remember the Table stuff next time I log on. But anyway... I finished!! Html basics tutorial is complete and much easier and more engaging than I expected. Bring on CSS and aesthetic goodness.
