Bars and pubs are a common small business customer for freelance web designers and developers.

Speed up your workflow and produce better, simpler sites with this checklist.

<!-- excerpt stop -->

Bars and pubs are a common small business customer for freelance web designers and developers.

This year I've been lucky enough to travel the world and drink at my fair share of bars. I recently looked up the websites of some I've visited. I turned my impressions into a 'Bar Website design checklist'.

I hope this helps you build bar websites faster and easier.


#### The TL;DR upfront

Simpler is better.

Something to keep in mind throughout the entire spec, design and build process, is WHO is going to update site content and HOW.

Bars are the type of business that seem to naturally attract and promote short shelf-life information. Menus, specials and upcoming events may quickly become stale, irrelevant or flat out wrong.

You should consider how active the client is *really* going to be in updating content.

In my opinion, aiming for a sense of timelessness on the website except for a few well considered features or pages is desirable.

### The design checklist plus commentary: ###

#### Include the essentials:

- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Logo</label>
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Address</label>
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Phone Number</label>
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Opening Hours</label>

Ideally put these on a header or sidebar so that they can be seen on every page.

Examples I found that did it well:

### Pages

I use the term 'pages' loosely here. If you are building a multi page website, each page is obviously a page, but on a single page website, consider each page listed below as a separate section.

The websites I looked at had an average of 6-7 pages or sections. I think some are unnecessary (we'll get into that soon) but almost everyone included these 3:

#### Home Page
<p class="subtitle">It's the landing page. Capture attention. Answer immediate questions (i.e. provide essentials above, *maybe* push exciting things happening).</p>

*Include:*

- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Bold photo (likely interior). Choose wisely, and please god shoot it professionally (this goes for all photos really.</label>
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> 1 short paragraph of creative copy that addresses the audience of the bar and the experience they can expect.</label>

Emphasis on this page more than any other should be on setting a style, theme, feeling, mood.

Examples I found that did it well:

[http://altstadtseattle.com/index.html](http://altstadtseattle.com/index.html)

#### Menu
<p class="subtitle">Let visitors explore the food and drink choices they will have if they visit.</p>

Menus need some special pre-consideration and discussion with your client. Is the menu long? Is it complex? How often does it change?

I think there are three reasonable ways to do menus:

<ol>
	<li>Link to PDF’s of the printed menus. Creating quality menu PDF’s is spending bar owners already justify against a budget that <em>isn't</em> web design. They probably have another designer doing this or skills in house. Help them get bang for buck by reusing those assets online. PDFs are also better than photos because they are searchable.</li>
	<li>Take the time to craft the menu in HTML and CSS. Again, searchable and better for mobile devices, but since changes to the menu are going to be made in the <em>actual</em> menu format first, you have to keep in mind that updating the website version is going to be an additional task.</li>
	<li>Don't list the menu. Instead use a description of what will be available.</li>
</ol>

Menu implementations I don't recommend:

- Interactive viewers (like PDF but worse).
- Photos of printed menus.

*Include:*

- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> 1-3 Good food/drink photos</label>
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Food Menu assets (or 1-2 para of creative copy)</label>
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Drinks Menu assets (or 1-2 para of creative copy)</label>

Examples I found that did it well:

#### Contact Us
<p class="subtitle">Make it feel like it's okay for patrons to contact the staff.</p>

*Include:*

- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Everyone seems to repeat all essential info here, and for some reason this is what I expect as a customer too.</label>
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Great place for a map and directions if it won't have it's own dedicated page</label>
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Great place for seasonal hours (especially around Xmas)</label>
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Social media links (although I saw these in more prominent places)</label>

Maybe:
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Contact form.</label>

Examples I found that did it well:

## Other pages to include depending on the type of establishment: ##

#### About Page
<p class="subtitle">Emphasise the unique aspects of the bar and what makes it special. Staff, location history etc.</p>

Necessity of this depends on how much of a description you put on the home page.

*Include:*

- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> 1-3 short paragraphs of creative copy</label>
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> 1-3 good quality photos</label>

Examples I found that did it well:

)

[http://malthousetavern.com/](http://malthousetavern.com/)

#### Events Page
<p class="subtitle">Give info about upcoming in bar events (music, quiz night etc)</p>

The best looking implementations of this have been ones that have kept it simple and readable.

Stick with text and good quality photos. Avoid plugins.

*Include for each:*

- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Date, event title, short event description</label>
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Arrange them in a logical order</label>

Examples I found that did it well:

![Good Events example](/img/blog/2014-11-25-great-bar-websites-checklist/bar-website-events-example.png
)

[https://barnightjar.com/whats-on](https://barnightjar.com/whats-on)

[http://havanabar.co.nz/#/Events](http://havanabar.co.nz/#/Events)

#### Reservations/Private Hire Page #
<p class="subtitle">Give info about reservations and how larger parties can use the venue.</p>

*Include:*

- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Reservation policy. Plain english. Nice and easy.</label>

If they do private events or book spaces:

- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> 1-3 photos of each space</label>
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Short description of space and how many people it accommodates (maybe in different layouts e.g. cocktail, theatre)</label>
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Floor plans are awesome (from my previous life of organising events)</label>

Examples I found that did it well:

[https://barnightjar.com/bookings](https://barnightjar.com/bookings)

#### Specials Page
<p class="subtitle">Effectively communicate daily, weekly or monthly specials.</p>

Like Events, stick to simple and readable.

Try to avoid repeating yourself. If the bar offer $2 beers all the time, consider a format  that clearly separates weekly from nightly specials.

*Include:*

- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Night (or date), Special Name, short description</label>
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Arrange them in a logical order</label>

Examples I found that did it well:

[http://altstadtseattle.com/happyhour.html](http://altstadtseattle.com/happyhour.html)

#### The page I dislike the most: Gallery Page
<p class="subtitle">Illustrate all the types of fun that can be had at said establishment.</p>

I really don't like galleries. My reason is that they are usually poorly implemented, stocked and maintained.

If you put one in, there is going to be a temptation to fill it. Because professional photography at your average bar is few and far between, it's likely going to get filled with samey amateur photos of over exposed drunk patrons. Push that stuff to Instagram or Facebook.

The only site I found doing a good job of this was [Nightjar](https://barnightjar.com/gallery/) (but as you may have already noticed the production quality - and I imagine budget - on this site is super high).


#### Other useful info
<p class="subtitle">Other great info that has low design impact.</p>

You *could* include on an appropriate existing page if applicable:

- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Types of payments accepted (particularly in the US)</label>
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Wifi symbol and "wifi available" if available</label>
- <label class="checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Driving/parking directions</label>

#### Big maybes

- App download page. If your client has one and it must be done, highlight WHAT benefit downloading the app is going to be to the patron and then make it really easy to do.

- Live beer feed. This is only going to come up for serious beer bars. Consider carefully as you're either building/integrating with an app or designing a slick human-process for updating the website mid-shift.

- Online shop for bar merchandise. You might come across this with you cult type bars. Unless it's [just a few items](http://cloudcannon.com/tutorials/2014/07/30/e-commerce-now-on-cloud-cannon-with-snipcart.html) going full-blown e-commerce is basically a completely different type of site.

- Customer testimonials. These feel out of place for me on a bar site. If your client has great customer testimonials, highlight them on sites like Yelp and Foursquare. If they don't have testimonials already, this is another thing to wait for before you can get this site signed off.

- Press page. These pages look lonely if there is not regular or recent press. It works on [this site](https://barnightjar.com/) (it's the 2nd best bar in the world apparently), but again, maybe not on your local. Instead choose a choice quote from any coverage and stick it on another page.

#### Avoid including:
<p class="subtitle">Challenge your client on including these site features.</p>

- Videos. None of the websites I visited did these well. Too much production quality is required to make a good impression.

- Fax numbers. Seeing this on a website makes the company seem technologically challenged.

- Social media feeds. You're going to the effort to create a website that's on brand for the bar and social media feeds are hard to integrate seamlessly. You can't control the content or the way it looks on your website.

- Blog. Blogs are like press pages and need to have regular content to come across credible and trustworthy. I freak out when CloudCannon goes two weeks without a post because people might think we've abandoned the business. If your client isn't going to dedicate the time to it in their normal business day, don't include it.

- Subscribe to mailing list. Similar to the blog. A dead email list implies regular communication. Use your judgement on the clients plans to use this channel. Suggest links to social media pages as a replacement.

- Links to other local businesses. Relevant suppliers maybe, but SEO has advanced past the need for link farming from local businesses. No 'link-for-a-link necessary' from your nearest drycleaner.

Annnnnddd....
- Today's date. Seriously. I saw this. And the date was incorrect. Much confusion.

And...

- <label class="checkbox-cross checkbox-label"><input type="checkbox"> Today's date. Seriously. You can live without this.</label>


#### Templates you can start from:

Keeping the above considerations in mind I had a look for appropriate templates to get your next project started.

Everything I could find targeted specifically at bars and pubs was way over engineered or really dated. Don't limit yourself to 'bar' templates in your search. Look for quality templates in general.

Here are a few that I think could work:

![Strata template](/img/blog/2014-11-25-great-bar-websites-checklist/strata-template.png
)

[Strata - free from HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net/strata)

Replace the home page and header with a big ol' sidebar. Keep those essentials and mood set throughout. Drop 'Recent work' for 'Menus.

![One Page Wonder template](/img/blog/2014-11-25-great-bar-websites-checklist/opw-template.png
)

[One Page Wonder - free from Startbootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/one-page-wonder/)

Super clean to start. Put essentials into the header - set and forget.

![Nimbus template](/img/blog/2014-11-25-great-bar-websites-checklist/nimbus-template.png
)

[Nimbus - free from CloudCannon](http://nimbus.cloudvent.net/)

One from us you could adjust. Header doesn't scroll but you've got space for an image up top to set the tone. Drop 'Benefits' for specials/events and 'Our Work' of Menus.
It's already set up for client editing on CloudCannon as well.

#### Conclusion

There's a huge opportunity out there for freelancers to build websites for bar and pub owners. A 'back-to-basics' approach will speed up turnaround and leave the client with a site they can be proud of and have a longer shelf-life.

#### The Bars!

I thought 30 bars was a good sample size. A third of the bars are ones I've been lucky enough to visit in my travels this year. The others are random bars from Yelp in Western markets that have websites (and half on Yelp didn't - freelance opportunity!).

All of the above is my opinion on bar website design of course. If you have any opinions of your own please share them below in the comments. I've intentionally left out some interesting statistics about these bar websites. I'll be doing a follow up post looking at the quantitative data for all you stats geeks.

If you haven't already, check out [CloudCannon](http://cloudcannon.com) - it's a low time investment way to add simple client editing to this type of website. If you need any help, just [flick us a message](mailto:support@cloudcannon.com), we're happy to help.
