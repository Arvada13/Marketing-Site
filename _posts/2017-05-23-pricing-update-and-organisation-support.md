Today we release a big improvement to the way teams use CloudCannon. Firstly, we have updated our pricing to be more team friendly and a simpler structure to get you going faster. Secondly, we added Organisations which will allow greater team management, branding and data sharing.

### Pricing Update

Within CloudCannon we have a wide range of users; Hobbyists, Freelancers, Agencies and Large Enterprise teams. We wanted a pricing structure that would enable all of the users, from individuals to large teams. Below are the three plans we have now:

<div class="plans">
    <div class="plan">
        <h4>Free</h4>
        <span class="price">Free</span>
        <p class="description">For development use only</p>
        <p>On the free plan, sharing and authentication are disabled, and viewers are shown a splash screen for your sites.</p>
        <p><i class="material-icons">check</i> Live test sites</p>
        <p><i class="material-icons">check</i> Syncing via GitHub, Bitbucket and Dropbox</p>
    </div>

    <div class="plan">
        <h4>Basic</h4>
        <span class="price monthly-price">$25/month</span>
        <span class="price annual-price">$250/year</span>
        <p class="description">Perfect for freelancers</p>

        <p><i class="material-icons">check</i> Unlimited production sites</p>
        <p><i class="material-icons">check</i> Free editing for clients</p>
    </div>

    <div class="plan">
        <h4>Pro</h4>
        <span class="price monthly-price">$75/month</span>
        <span class="price annual-price">$750/year</span>
        <p class="description">For teams of any size</p>

        <p><i class="material-icons">check</i> <strong>5 Team members included</strong></p>
        <p><i class="material-icons">check</i> Organisation support</p>
        <p><i class="material-icons">check</i> Custom branding</p>
    </div>
</div>

The old Agency and Enterprise plans have been merged into the new Pro plan. This plan is $75 dollars and includes 5 team members. The cost of additional users on all plans has been reduced to $25 each. The Pro plan has all of the features of Enterprise with the addition of Organisation support. All existing Agency and Enterprise customers have bee automatically been migrated to the Pro plan. You can check out the new plans within the app or on our pricing page.

### Organisation Support

Team management has just become much easier on CloudCannon. Organisations adds a way of creating an account for your team. The account can me managed by different people and permissions can be defined. This gives you more control over the privileges and experience your team members have. To read more about team management, check out our organisation team documentation.

At the core of Organisations we wanted you to be able to create a custom experience for your team. This starts with two assets; a badge and a logo. To read more about organisation branding, check out our organisation branding documentation.

Enterprise team management can become difficult with so many people. To make this easier we have added SAML support to Organisations. Connect CloudCannon to your Identity Provider and we will automatically create accounts attached to your Organisation. These users will only be allowed to login via your system which gives full control over who has access.

### What's Next?

This is our largest release in 2017 so far, we hope to keep up this momentum and bring in some highly requested features soon. In the next few months we plan to improve our SSL offering, provide better support for large sites, and generally improve existing features. As always our feature development is driven by user feedback and usage statistics. If you need anything or just want a chat be sure to reach out to support.
