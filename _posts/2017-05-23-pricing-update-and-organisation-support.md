Today we are announcing a big improvement to the way teams use CloudCannon. Firstly, we have updated our pricing to be more team friendly and a simpler structure to get you going faster. Secondly, we added Organisations which allows greater team management, branding and data sharing.

### Improved Team Pricing

Within CloudCannon we have a wide range of users; hobbyists, freelancers, agencies and large enterprise teams. We wanted a pricing structure that would enable all of the users, from individuals to large teams. Below are the plans available now:

<div class="plans">
    <div class="plan">
        <h4>Free</h4>
        <span class="price">Free</span>
        <p class="description">Great for development</p>
        <p><i class="material-icons">check</i> Live test sites</p>
        <p><i class="material-icons">check</i> GitHub, Bitbucket and Dropbox syncing</p>
        <p class="disabled-state"><i class="material-icons">lock_outline</i>Sharing disabled</p>
        <p class="disabled-state"><i class="material-icons">lock_outline</i>Authentication disabled</p>
    </div>

    <div class="plan">
        <h4>Basic</h4>
        <span class="price monthly-price">$25/month</span>
        <span class="price annual-price">$250/year</span>
        <p class="description">Perfect for freelancers</p>

    </div>

    <div class="plan">
        <h4>Pro</h4>
        <span class="price monthly-price">$75/month</span>
        <span class="price annual-price">$750/year</span>
        <p class="description">For teams of any size</p>

        <p><i class="material-icons">check</i> <strong>5 Team members included</strong></p>
        <p><i class="material-icons">check</i> Organisation support</p>
        <p><i class="material-icons">check</i> Custom branding</p>
        <p><i class="material-icons">check</i> Team Sharing</p>
        <p><i class="material-icons">check</i> SAML support</p>
    </div>
</div>

The old Agency and Enterprise plans have been merged into the new Pro plan. This plan is $75 dollars and includes 5 team members. The cost of additional users on all plans has been reduced to $25 each. The Pro plan has Organisation support and all existing Enterprise features.  You can check out the new plans within your
*account settings* or on [our pricing page](/pricing/). All existing Agency and Enterprise customers have been automatically migrated to the Pro plan.

### Organisation Support

Organisations adds a way of creating an account for your team. The account can be managed by different people with different permission levels. This gives you more control over the privileges and experience your team members have. Read more in the [organisation team documentation](#).

At the core of Organisations we wanted you to be able to create a custom experience for your team. This starts with two assets; a badge and a logo. Read more in the [organisation branding documentation](#).

Enterprise team management is often solved internally with a SAML Identity Provider (IdP). To make this easier we have added SAML support to Organisations. Connect CloudCannon to your IdP and we will automatically create accounts attached to your Organisation. Read more in the [organisation SAML documentation](#).

To ease the transfer to Organisations we have added the ability to transfer sites between accounts. Transfers ensure all data related to a site is transferred to the new owner with a request and accept process. Read more in the [transfers documentation](#).

### What's Next?

This is our largest release in 2017 so far, we plan to keep up this momentum and bring in some highly requested features soon. In the next few months we plan to improve our SSL offering, provide better support for large sites, and generally improve existing features. As always our feature development is driven by user feedback and usage statistics. If you need anything or just want a chat be sure to reach out to support.

**TLDR;** Better team pricing, Organisations support and transfer sites.
