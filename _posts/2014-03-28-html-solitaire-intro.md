Recently we released an <a target="_blank" href="http://solitaire.cloudvent.net">HTML5 Solitaire Game</a> built on CloudCannon. There were quite a few people keen to read some tutorials that outline how it was built.

Over the next month the posts I am going to cover are:

* The HTML and CSS to build cards
* Creating the Interface
* Writing the logic in Backbone.js

Are there any other topics in you would want to me to write about?
