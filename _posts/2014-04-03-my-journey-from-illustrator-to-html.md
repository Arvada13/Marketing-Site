This blog will document the journey of a totally code-naive designer (me) as I attempt to learn to
code. My attempts will no doubt be laughable to any one who has any experience in the digital
realm. 

### Code 101: Learning the basics
 
To give a brief overview of myself; I recently completed my Bachelor of Design Innovation (what
does that even mean??) at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. I majored in Industrial
Design which was mostly product design & manufacture based. My final university project ever
involved doing some branding & identity and designing an app, and it was then that I finally was like
‘damn, this is fun! I want to do more of this type of thing.’ Since then I have been working with
various small-scale business helping them with their branding, UI and UX design. Very quickly I
found out that it was not enough for me to just to pretty photoshop layouts, I actually had to learn to
code them. So here it goes.. 

#### Where to begin

A developer friend had mentioned [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) to me so I thought I’d jump on that. First (of
many) surprises; there was more than one type of code to learn, in fact on the main page there are
six and all of them are described as the ‘most popular’ or ‘building blocks of web development’ or
‘powerful yet beginner-friendly’ or ‘learn the fundamentals’ aka they are ALL the easiest, most
important, best language for a beginner to learn. Instead of taking a lucky dip I went back to
aforementioned friend and asked for their advice. Important note: what I want to achieve by
learning to code is to be able to code my own websites and apps on a basic level so I can
demonstrate what I want to a client or show it to a kickass developer who could understand it
enough to then turn it into a super fast, fully functional product. And so it was decided I would start
with HTML.

 #### Color not Colour

First tutorials were pretty easy to follow, I learnt how to make words link to different webpages,
insert images and make images link to webpages. This was a pretty big thing for me cause I
thought it would take me a couple of weeks of practice but actually it only took about 45min of
Codecademy tutorials. One thing that did annoy my designer side was that what I was making was
super ugly; the font style/size/colour etc but I do realise this is what CSS is for. Also I got really
frustrated when one tutorial would not let me advance because I had made an error and I redid it
about ten times to no avail, eventually someone pointed out to me that I had spelt ‘colour’ wrong,
because HTML is written in American English.

After making my own shitty 90’s style webpage about myself with clickable images and links, and
proudly showing it to my ﬂatmates I moved on to the List Making tutorials which were not as
interesting because I don’t want to make lists, but perhaps that is is actually something developers
frequently use? I’m unsure because I started listing things on my mind, the numero uno thing was
food and so I got hungry and stopped my tutorials.

 #### Final thoughts

Overall, much easier to understand than I had thought big ups to Codecademy for making such
great (and FREE) lessons that can make novices feel like pros. Next step, making my site live in
60 seconds with CloudCannon!
