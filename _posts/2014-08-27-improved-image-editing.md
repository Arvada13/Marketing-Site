Take a look at the new workflows.

The latest update to CloudCannon has been focused on making it easier to edit images using the visual editor. The online file browser also got a few tweaks..

### Image editing ###

The old image editor had limited options. You could only completely replace an image with a newly uploaded one or update an image description.

The new image editor now has more options for sourcing images, we've gotten rid of the page obscuring alert window, and packed it all into a much less intrusive menu.

*Check out that sleek menu just beside the image to be edited*

The old system was also not very smart. You could replace an image on a website with another image of any dimension through the visual editor.

This led to many disasterous scenarios.

For example:

You finish the website layout and give it to the client...

![Nice page layout](/img/blog/improved-image-editing/sameSizeProducts.png)
*Nice and orderly*

...they unwittingly make a few image changes with a variety of different dimensions...

![Change all the image sizes!](/img/blog/improved-image-editing/changealltheimagesizes.jpg)
*Oh client, you are so enthusiastic*

...and you both end up with the something like this.

*\*sigh\**

Now CloudCannon is smarter. It uses the original dimensions of images inserted in the HTML as hard guidelines for the visual editor.

Sam likes to think of it as punching fixed size windows in the page that the client can then adjust an image in or find a new image to put into.

That's not quite accurate but I can see what he means.

Check out this this image alteration example:

<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop">
	<source src="/img/blog/improved-image-editing/SameImgUpdate.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
	<source src="/img/blog/improved-image-editing/SameImgUpdate.ogv" type="video/ogg" />
	Your browser does not support the video tag :(.
</video>

And watch this image replacement:

<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="800px">
	<source src="/img/blog/improved-image-editing/URLImageUpdate.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
	<source src="/img/blog/improved-image-editing/URLImageUpdate.ogv" type="video/ogg" />
	Your browser does not support the video tag :(.
</video>

These changes to image editing should make the experience much more straightforward for you and your clients.

### File browser updates ###

Other subtle changes in this latest update relate to the file browser.

All files and folders now have a menu associated with them that can be accessed by mousing over the top right corner.

![Menus associated with files and folders](/img/blog/improved-image-editing/filemenu.png)
*Mouse over top right for menu, click, and all is revealed.*

Of note is the ability to copy links to site assets directly from file browser menu. This should really help you marketers out there.

*Link to specific content (especially downloadables!) directly.*

As always, thanks for reading and thanks for using CloudCannon.

I'd really like to hear of how our new take on image editing works for you and your clients!
