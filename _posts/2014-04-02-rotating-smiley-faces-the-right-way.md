I recently released a small script I built last year. I took the time to clean it up and I thought you all might enjoy it.

I'm proud to announce the Smiley.js Jquery plugin. This tiny plugin can take some ordinary looking smiley faces and turn them into things that people actually recognise :D --> <span class="cheese">:D</span>.

## How do I use it?
CloudCannon is kindly giving the power of Smileys to everyone. If you want to use it just check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GeorgePhillips/Smiley.js">github repo</a> and add the files to your site.

### Step 1 - Add the happiness
Add the smileys.css file to the head.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="smiley.css"&gt;</pre>

Add smileys.js to the end of the body after JQuery
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;script src="smileys.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

### Step 2 - Smilify
Just call smilify on any element as you would any other JQuery function.
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">$("selector").smilify();</pre>
