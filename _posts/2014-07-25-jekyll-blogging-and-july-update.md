 At CloudCannon we’ve been extremely busy over the last 3 months. But admittedly, not very vocal. Since we last sent out an update there have been both new features added to the CloudCannon app and a new face added to the CloudCannon team.

Here’s a recap of what’s been going on:

### Blogging is coming to CloudCannon! ###
When we first started CloudCannon we thought that we’d only ever serve static sites. However the sheer number of requests for blog support lead us to reconsider.

Lately we've been working on an integration with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator which has become extremely popular.

Our Jekyll feature set is currently in private beta right now. To get early access to blogging on CloudCannon head over to [cloudcannon.com/jekyll](/jekyll).

### App look and feel ###

Three big changes you might have noticed about how CloudCannon looks:


* We’ve done a complete redesign of the designer browser interface.
We’ve changed icons to be larger, more colourful (yes we speak UK english) and clearer.

* Configuration from the Designer view is also now much much easier. Config has it’s own tab down the left hand menu. Better than a couple of buttons along the bottom we had previously.

* The client editing experience has been made much smoother, particularly around site navigation.
Users can now navigate their site in the editor view much like the would normally (click buttons, follow internal links, etc) and make changes as they go.

### New Functionality ###

You can now host multiple websites on a single domain.
E.g. Example.com might point to your main site, while sale.example.com might point to a new separate landing page.

This functionality is enabled by creating a new ‘website’ under an already used domain. Detection that the domain is already used on your primary site is automatic and will present you new settings.


### Performance updates ###

* Syncing is faster now. Small updates should be live almost instantly.

* Adding a template to a website will also be much faster now.

### Minor usability updates ###

* When you or your client has made changes and your site is syncing, we’ve added some icons to indicate the sync state.

* Filenames are now smarter. They span over two lines and truncate in the middle.

* We’ve added some sexy alert messages that pop out of the bottom right of your screen to let you know what’s going on.

### Other stuff ###

* We got a new favicon. Awwww yeah.

### New faces ###

Until now, CloudCannon has just been George and I. We’ve achieved a lot to date, but we have bigger visions for what CloudCannon can be and what our community of awesome web designers will be capable of.

You might remember that [we recently went through a business accelerator programme in New Zealand](/company/2014/03/30/lightning-lab.html).

Wow, did two computer science majors learn a lot about running a business!

One of the main things we took away from that experience is that to achieve what we want, we’re going to have to grow.

With that in mind, we’re excited to officially welcome Sam Bonney to the team as our Head of Marketing.

<p style="text-align:center">Sam Bonney, our new Head of Marketing.</p>

He loves [cravats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_tie#Popularity_of_the_day_cravat) and [noodles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_noodles)! [Often together](/img/blog/july14-update/sam_2.jpg).

We met Sam during our time in the accelerator - he was running it! - and as well as getting along with him like a house on fire, we realised that he brings a completely different way of thinking to CloudCannon.

Sam understands how lots of different kinds of businesses run and we think thats going to be crucial not only for us, but for all of our users who have to 'run the business' of being a freelance web designer, small agency or DIY business owner.

Sam’s been with us for a few weeks now so you may already have received an email or two from him.


With a bit more man power around the place, communication from us is going to be a lot more regular (for real this time).

That's all for now. We're currently working on a  secret project which will change the way you migrate websites. Stay tuned for details.
