Today we're announcing __two brand-new features__ which will help you make __kick-ass__ websites.

### Form Submissions ###
First up is form submissions. Most websites have a contact form for visitors to get in touch. Traditionally, to set up a contact form you'd either have to write a __complicated__ server side script or use an __expensive__ third party service. With CloudCannon, you can set up a normal HTML form on your webpage, then when visitors submit the form the details are __automatically__ sent to the email addresses you specify. Seriously, now you can set up a contact form in __under 60 seconds__. Have a look at our [documentation for form submissions](/docs/#form_submissions) for more details.

### Redirects ###
We've also added redirects to CloudCannon. When you change the structure of your website you might want the old URLs to redirect to new pages. Now you can set this up on CloudCannon so your website doesn't break for visitors when you start renaming files. Checkout our [documentation](/docs/#301_redirects) for more details on how to set this up.

### Documentation ###
The documentation has been also been __completely revamped__ to make it easier to understand.

We can't wait to see what you create.
