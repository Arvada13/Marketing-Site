In the past two weeks weâ€™ve released major features to make CloudCannon easier to use. Thanks to all the customers who have provided valuable feedback which inspired these changes.

### Editables everywhere

Before editable elements needed to be in the base HTML page. Now editable elements can be in any layout or include. Update sidebars, headers and footers across many pages in the visual editor. CloudCannon will detect where the editables came from then update the relevant files. Give it a try by adding `class="editable"` in an include or layout.

### Better Navigation

Navigation and routing is cleaned up in the app. We removed the ugly hash that was in the URL and changed that to a path everyone can understand. Refactored developer views are all available under the browser namespace. The new breadcrumbs inside the code view are an easy way to transition back to the parent folders.

The Collection view got a similar refresh with a neat breadcrumb and nicer URL.

The visual editor has had the biggest change. URLs now use the output URL which allows you to view all pages within the app. The title of the page replaces the breadcrumb. We removed the preview option as you can now navigate links inside editables. To preview, keep your mouse still and the yellow boxes will go away.

Across all three of these sections we have changed the view toggle to a view change. The current state is automatically hidden to reduce the number of buttons shown.

### New Link Editor

Adding and updating links is an essential part of CloudCannon and needed a refresh. The new link editor:

* Has the option to link to a page
* Prevents you accidentally linking to the source HTML and Markdown files
* Allows navigating to the current link
* Is consistent with the image editor controls

### Case studies

We recently interviewed a few of our power users to see how it was working for them. [Netflix](/customers/netflix/), [Engine Yard](/customers/engine-yard/), [Xtendly](/customers/xtendly/) and [Brandon Setter](/customers/brandon-setter/) all had great things to say about CloudCannon.

Many of these changes are based on suggestions. You can make a suggestion by contacting us in the app or at [support@cloudcannon.com](mailto:support@cloudcannon.com). Good or bad, let us know what you think.
