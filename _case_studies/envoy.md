## Challenge

Envoy has revolutionised the visitor/host experience in the workplace. As a fast growing company, Envoy needs ways of quickly experimenting with new landing pages and content.

Previously, Envoy marketers would communicate the changes they wanted to make to the websites to developers. This created bottlenecks and made it time consuming to push out new content.

Envoy needs to:

* Have marketers publish content without involving developers
* Provide an interface marketers can update and build new pages
* Preview content before its pushed live
* Host the websites on their own Heroku instance

## How CloudCannon helps

With CloudCannon, the marketing team iterates on content in a staging environment and promotes it to production without involving a developer. Developers set up front matter to enable marketers use to build complex page structures.

## Editing

The marketing team no longer needs to go through a developer to get content on the site. They can create new case studies, blog posts and landing  pages independently.

## Staging preview

The marketing team previews content on a staging website to ensure everything is working before pushing it production. When they push to production, CloudCannon performs a merges branches which triggers a deployment script to push it to their hosting on Heroku.

## Content search

Envoy marketers can filter their posts and case studies using the built in search in CloudCannon to find the content they're looking for.

## Landing Pages

Envoy spins up landing pages with CloudCannon to test new ideas with Google AdWord campaigns. The developers created a card system using front matter to allow marketers to control even complex UI elements.
