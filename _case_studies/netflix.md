## Challenge

Netflix is the world’s leading Internet television network. The company works hard to provide its partners and consumers with information at a fast pace. To do this, Netflix ensures informational websites stay up to date with relevant and engaging content.

Drupal was previously used for informational websites such as [Netflix Devices](https://devices.netflix.com). However, the marketing team struggled to make the edits they needed, often requiring help from developers. Developers had to spend significant resources to keep the websites online for millions of Netflix customers.

Netflix needs to:

* Create and maintain public and internal websites
* Provide an editing interface marketers find easy to use
* Translate their websites into 20 languages
* Use a stable hosting platform scaling to their audience

## How CloudCannon helps

Netflix ran a pilot with [Netflix Devices](https://devices.netflix.com) to see if a Jekyll/CloudCannon solution would fit their requirements. The pilot was a success and Netflix now has many websites hosted and updated on CloudCannon.

### Editing

The marketing team have taken control of their site, they’re able to quickly try new messaging and update content without involving a developer. Netflix Devices has a staging website set up so the marketing team can try out changes before pushing it to the live website.

The marketing team updates HTML content directly on the website:

### SAML authentication

Netflix has internal websites for partners and Netflix employees. CloudCannon SAML authentication enables Netflix to give select users access to these websites while making them private to everyone else.

### Translations

To support their global audience, Netflix translates their websites into several languages. The marketing team updates content in English, this content is sent to the their translation team, which is then loaded into CloudCannon Internationalisation and served on the live website.
