## Challenge

Netflix is the world’s leading Internet television network. The company works hard to provide its partners and consumers with information at a fast pace. To do this, Netflix ensures informational websites stay up to date with relevant and engaging content.

Drupal was previously used for informational websites such as [Netflix Devices](https://devices.netflix.com). However, the marketing team struggled to make the edits they needed, often requiring help from developers. Developers had to spend significant resources to keep the websites online for Netflix's millions of customers.

Netflix needed:

* A fast-paced way to create and maintain public and internal micro-sites
* An editing interface marketers find easy to use
* A way to translate their websites into 20 languages
* A stable hosting platform that scales to their audience

## How CloudCannon helped

Netflix ran a pilot with [Netflix Devices](https://devices.netflix.com) to see if a Jekyll/CloudCannon solution would fit their requirements. The pilot was a success and Netflix now has many websites hosted and updated on CloudCannon.

### Hosting

With CloudCannon hosting, websites load quickly and scale reliably to millions of Netflix visitors. The developers don't need to set up servers, keep plugins updated or handle traffic spikes.

### Editing

The marketing team have taken control of their site, they’re able to quickly try new messaging and update content without involving a developer. Netflix Devices has a staging website set up so the marketing team can try out changes before pushing it to the live website.

They update HTML content directly on the website:

And update and manage structured collection data:

### SAML authentication

Netflix has internal websites for partners and Netflix employees. CloudCannon SAML authentication enables Netflix to give select users access to these websites while making them private to everyone else.

### Translations

To support their global audience, Netflix needs their websites translated into over 20 languages. With CloudCannon, the marketing team updates content in English, this content is sent to the their translation team to translate the text which is loaded back into CloudCannon and served on the live website.
