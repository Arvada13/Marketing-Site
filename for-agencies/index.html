	    <h4>Simplifying the building process</h4>
	        <p>Whether your site builds are fully static or powered by Jekyll, CloudCannon lets your team focus their time where they add value - designing and building. Whether you normally start from scratch, a framework like Bootstrap, or an HTML5 theme, you have the freedom to create anything with HTML and CSS.</p>
	        
        <h4>Building as a team</h4>
            <p>Agencies bring the power of a team to a site build. CloudCannon allows multiple developers, designers and content writers to contribute.</p>
            <p>Changes can be seen instantly in a live test-website environment.</p>
            <p>A move from dynamic to static site building workflows also opens up the opportunity for git-backed source control. All changes to the website can be tracked and versions can be rolled back to.</p>

        <h4>Involving clients</h4>
            <p>When it's time to get the client involved site editing is straightforward. For most clients, password protected editing accessed at siteurl.com/update is all that is needed.</p>
            <p>Clients are able to edit page elements (text, images, lists, links, etc) that you set using 'class="editable"'. You have the power to give confident clients lots of options, and limit inexperienced clients to the simplest of changes.</p>
            <p>For reinforcement of agency relationship, client interfaces can be whitelabelled.</p>
            
        <h4>Simple site management</h4>
        <p>More client sites is good for your business so CloudCannon makes it easy to manage multiple sites from the dashboard.</p>
