# CloudCannon simplifies site building.

CloudCannon takes care of site infrastructure like hosting, CDN's and optimization
so you can spend your time where you add value - designing and building.

Without traditional CMS architecture to worry about, you can design any static site you
like in HTML and CSS. Start from scratch, a framework like Bootstrap, or any HTML5
theme on the web,

If you need more features in your site build, CloudCannon also supports the Jekyll
static site generator.

While you are building you'll always have a live preview of the site available.

# Easy client editing

When it's time to get the client involved site editing is straightforward. For
most clients, password protected editing accessed at siteurl.com/update is all
that is needed.

Clients are able to edit page elements (text, images, lists, links, etc) that you
set using 'class="editable"'. You have the power to give confident clients lots
of options, and limit inexperienced clients to the simplest of changes.

# Simple site management

More client sites is good for your business so CloudCannon makes it easy to manage
multiple sites from the dashboard.

With simple pricing that grows as you do, CloudCannon is a low risk choice for
freelancers.

		<p> We believe building websites should be simple for developers. You shouldn't have read pages of documentation just to build a simple website. You shouldn't have to worry if installing a plugin is going to make your site vulnerable or unscalable. And you certainly shouldn't be hesitant to make an update because it might break something on the live website.</p>

		<p> We love static websites because they're: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fast to build</li>
			<li>Simple</li>
			<li>Scalable</li>
			<li>Secure</li>
			<li>Source control backed</li>
			<li>Powerful - with <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com">static site generators</a> and <a target="_blank"  href="http://cloudcannon.com/tips/2014/12/12/the-ultimate-list-of-services-for-static-websites.html">3rd party plugins</a>, there's not a lot you can't do  </li>
		</ul>

			<p> Our mission is to bring static websites to the mainstream. CloudCannon unites developers and non-technical content editors by providing the best of both worlds.  Developers build static websites to gain all the advantages listed above. Non-technical content writers can make updates quickly and easily without any coding. </p>
