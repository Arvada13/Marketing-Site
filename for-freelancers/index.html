	    <h4>CloudCannon simplifies site building</h4>
	        <p>CloudCannon takes care of site infrastructure like hosting, CDN's and optimization so you can spend your time where you add value - designing and building.</p>
	        <p>Without traditional CMS architecture to worry about, you can design any static site you like in HTML and CSS. Start from scratch, a framework like Bootstrap, or any HTML5 theme on the web.</p>
	        <p>If you need more features in your site build, CloudCannon also supports the Jekyll static site generator.</p>
	        <p>While you are building you'll always have a live preview of the site available.</p>

        <h4>Easy client editing</h4>
            <p>When it's time to get the client involved site editing is straightforward. For most clients, password protected editing accessed at siteurl.com/update is all that is needed.</p>
            <p>Clients are able to edit page elements (text, images, lists, links, etc) that you set using 'class="editable"'. You have the power to give confident clients lots of options, and limit inexperienced clients to the simplest of changes.</p>

        <h4>Simple site management</h4>
            <p>More client sites is good for your business so CloudCannon makes it easy to manage multiple sites from the dashboard.</p>
            <p>With simple pricing that grows as you do, CloudCannon is a low risk choice for freelancers.</p>
