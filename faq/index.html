			<dt>Q: How is this different from Dropbox Public Folders?</dt>
			<dd>A: Using Dropbox Public Folders is an easy way to share files on the internet, CloudCannon is a platform for web designers so our goals are slightly different. CloudCannon provides an integrated content management system and a host of other features to make a designer's life easier. We also have no bandwidth restrictions for sites hosted on CloudCannon and do a number of optimizations to make the sites load as fast as possible.</dd>

			<dt>Q: Can I use SQL/PHP/Rails with CloudCannon?</dt>
			<dd>A: No, CloudCannon is focussed on front-end technology. However, CloudCannon provides powerful templating features to replace these technologies (See our <a href="/docs#templating">docs</a> for more information). You can also add dynamic content by embedding 3rd party services such as <a href="http://www.wufoo.com/">Wufoo</a> or <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>.</dd>

			<dt>Q: What file types are supported?</dt>
			<dd>A: We currently sync files with the following extensions - <code>js, css, less, gif, jpe, jpg, jpeg, png, htm, html, pdf, txt, zip, swf, svg, json, xml, woff, eot, ttf, tte, otf, ico, htc, xsl, mp3, m4a, ogg, oga, web, wav, mp4, web, ogv, map</code>.</dd>

			<dt>Q: Can I use my own domain? </dt>
			<dd>A: Yes. You can either use your own domain or we supply <em>&lt;yourname&gt;</em>.cloudvent.net domains.</dd>

			<dt>Q: Are there any file size limits </dt>
			<dd>A: Yes, there's a 200MB limit on files synced through Dropbox or the website. Anything bigger probably belongs on YouTube or a 3rd party file sharing website.</dd>

			<dt>Q: Do you provide email hosting? </dt>
			<dd>A: No, however you can easily use an emailing hosting specialist alongside CloudCannon. <a href="http://goo.gl/VIVQB6">Here's a list of the best email hosts out there</a>.</dd>

			<dt>Q: Does CloudCannon support SAML based SSO?</dt>
			<dd>A: Yes, and our partner OneLogin has a free plan for CloudCannon - find out more at <a href="http://www.onelogin.com/partners/app-partners/cloudcannon/">our OneLogin partner page</a>. To set this up email us at <a href="mailto:support@cloudcannon.com">support@cloudcannon.com</a>.</dd>

			<dt>Q: What elements can be made editable?</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>A: We split our editable elements into three different categories; Block, text and special elements. Each type acts slightly different in the editor.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Block elements: <code>div, section, article, aside, footer, header, nav</code></li>
					<li>Text elements: <code>p, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6</code></li>
					<li>Special elements: <code>img</code></li>
				</ul>
